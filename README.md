The largest project in my 3 piece 'More Games in C++' portfolio. Created in a group of four, Four Ferrets is a top down heist game where the players must work together as a team to steal a deadly bio-weapon. 

My main responsibilities in this project were the backend wrapper (eg scene/gameobject, thread and audio handling) and gameplay elements (eg security cameras, guards, players and pickups).
